##Overview
- CSS ...or "here come the acronyms"!
	- SASS as a language
	- OOCSS as the concept
	- BEM as a naming convention
- Pattern Library
	- build components in an isolated environment

##CSS re-introduction
- display block, inline, inline-block
- positioning
	- static (I'm not even really positioning)
	- relative
	- absolute
	- you won't need fixed
- floats
- centering

###SASS
Variables
	- variable naming
		- what it represents, not how its used
Nesting
It CAN be good
But don't do it
	- selector importance wars
	- Inception rule
		- "Never go more than 3 levels deep"
	- solution: modifiers
		- mention naming: what it is VS where it is.
		- Cascading is good
Entending Classes
	- placeholders (%selector)
Mixins
Mixins vs extending Classes
	- mixins duplicate content
	- Why use them?
		- parameters

###OOCSS
DRY
	- Don't Repeat Yourself
Separate out common functionality
	- Island Class
	- Media Object
Separating style from positioning


###BEM
Naming things with BEM
Block, Element, Modfier
Block
	- Something that stands on its own
	-
