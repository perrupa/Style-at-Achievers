# The Pattern Library

---

##What is it?

The pattern library is several things :

- A resource for developers to find commonly used design patterns
- Documentation for our code and its different possible uses
- A sandbox for component development

---

# As a dev resource

We wanted a resource for developers where they could find code examples to copy and paste for feature development or rapid prototyping.


Inspired by Twitter Bootstrap, we wanted a solid visual framework so that simple HTML could look great and fit into the mood and style of the Achievers platform.

# Documentation

> __"How do I use this class?"__
>
> Every Developer at some point in time

We needed a good place to put code examples free of external influences.

A place to see the markup and resulting HTML outside of a feature, that might have other requirements or styles that affect its components.

# A Development Sandbox

__Benefits :__ 

- A place free of external influences to develop code
- It is inside the platform with all the normal resources
- We know the components's dependencies before it's moved into our feature.
- Guaranteed portability of our code, classes and JS.
